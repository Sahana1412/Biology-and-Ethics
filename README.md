FOXG1 (Forkhead Box G1) is a critical transcription factor involved in brain development. Mutations in FOXG1 can lead to severe neurological disorders, including:
FOXG1 Syndrome (Atypical Rett Syndrome)
Brain malformations (e.g., microcephaly)
Autism spectrum disorders
FOXG1 mutations affect neurodevelopmental pathways.
Identifying mutations helps personalize treatments.
Drugs can be selected based on mutation type & pathway disruption.
